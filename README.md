The process is initiated when the patient discovers that they have a medical concern or need to make an appointment. The patient then decides on if they should or shouldn’t make an appointment. If so, the patient calls the insurance company. The insurance representative requests for the patient’s information. The requested information most likely includes name, date of birth, policy number, address, or social security number.
