The process is initiated when the patient discovers that they have a medical concern or need to make an appointment. The patient then decides if they should or should not make an appointment. If so, the patient calls the insurance company. The insurance representative requests for the patient’s information. The requested information most likely includes the name, date of birth, policy number, address, or social security number. This information is processed and documented through the insurance company’s internal system to locate the patient’s record. The representative then provides the patient with a list of primary care physicians within the patient’s area. The patient would then decide which provider best fits their preferences. The representative schedules the appointment with the selected provider. The call would then end once the patient’s appointment has been scheduled. The patient should then receive a confirmation email shortly after that contains their new provider and appointment information.
